    <p> This is an exercise in content design and in Astro's front end capabilities. </p>
    <p>We have tons of exceptional and unique digital content, that is for the most part neglected.</p>
    <p>I'm using typography, color, and layout to show how unique content types can live harmoniously under the same umbrella.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to design exploration this was originally built to feel out the proposed tech stack and it feels good. It makes me want to build.</p>
